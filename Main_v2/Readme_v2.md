### Corrections and small modifications on v2:  
- Another alignment purpose, which saves space  
- The Emergency-Switch now is placed within the "On"-Switch wiring-line. Previoulsy it was wrongly placed within "Off"-Switch line.  
- A second, passive 220k&Omega-Resistor is placed after the Reversing-Switch between the two Motor-Supply-Lines (U1 and U2), instead on the wiring-board, to ensure save voltage-unload of the Motor-"Fire" EMI-Filter.
